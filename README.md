# eNRTL_Fitting_Routine
A fitting routine using the IDAES framework along with PYOMO to fit eNRTL parameters and display the results

This routine uses an idaes-pse version that comes from a specific branch from Douglas Allen's forked idaes-pse repo. The branch is called eNRTL. The url of the repo is https://github.com/dallan-keylogic/idaes-pse.git and you can clone the specific "eNRTL" branch from this repo

Two packages should be installed to allow the analysis to run, `pdf2image` and `pdflatex`
